# My CV as a site

Welcome!

As part of my course I've put together a simple little interactive CV of sorts.

Most data is factual, aside from some of the contact info, which is mostly there as placeholder text.

Similarly, the social media icons are currently just for show, I'm present on less than half of them, and I'd show even fewer to prospective employers.
They're not outrageous or anything, but they're also just not professional.

The contact form also goes nowhere, so if you need to contact me send me a message on GitHub.

Nearly all of the styles and formatting are taken directly from the course, so I'll likely return to this later to customize the project and make it more my own.
